# DESIGN — M0 round trip: what we are building, testing and deciding

The **in-flight** half. [`ROUNDTRIP.md`](../../ROUNDTRIP.md) holds only what is settled —
definitions, proved propositions, and crawler's measured constraints `X1`–`X10`. **Everything
here is a proposal, a hypothesis or an open question**, and none of it should be cited as fact.

Plan status, phases and ordering: [`README.md`](README.md).

## 1. Proposed laws — beyond the settled `D`/`E₂` core

Each is a **design claim**, not a theorem. Notation `A₁ … K₂` is the working numbering.

| # | law | statement | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A₁** | canonicity | `∀m. read(write(m)) = m` ∧ `∀T. write(read(T)) = T` | proposed |
| **A₂** | monotone extension | `𝕋ₙ ⊆ 𝕋ₙ₊₁`, and `∀T ∈ 𝕋ₙ`: same model, same field, **same bytes**; `𝕄*` grows, never shrinks (§4) | proposed |
| **B** | projection | `∀m ∈ 𝕄. σ(σ(m)) = σ(m)` ∧ `ρ(σ(m)) = 0` | proposed |
| **C₁** | fitting = fixed point | `∀m ∈ 𝕄. m ∈ 𝕄* ⟺ σ(m) = m` | proposed |
| **C₂** | closure under operations | `∀m ∈ 𝕄*, ∀op ∈ Ops. op(m) ∈ 𝕄*`, `Ops = {flip, place, combine, damage, seat}` (§5) | proposed |
| **D** | round trip | `rebuild(draw(m)) = m` | **the target** |
| **E₁** | totality | `∀f ∈ 𝔽. rebuild(f) ∈ 𝕄*` — never fails, never returns a non-fitting model | proposed |
| **E₂** | exactness on `im(draw)` | `rebuild ∘ draw ∘ rebuild = rebuild`, `ρ = 0` | **the target** |
| **E₃** | approximation off it | `f ∉ im(draw)` → `(m′, ρ)` with `ρ` **reported**; `ρ > 0` expected (§3) | proposed |
| **F** | injectivity | `draw(m₁) = draw(m₂) ⟹ m₁ = m₂` | follows from D; its *coverage* is measured |
| **G** | flip commutation | `rebuild(flip_𝔽(draw(m))) = σ(flip_𝕄(m))` | **pending OD-5** |
| **H** | flip stability | `φ ≔ σ ∘ flip_𝕄`; `φ²ⁿ(m) = m` | **pending OD-5** — may be a theorem, given `X2` |
| **I** | `O`-equivariance | `draw(τ_v ∘ o · m) = τ_v ∘ o · draw(m)` | **GREEN** (`housetest`) |
| **J** | stencil closure | `Σᵢ lenᵢ·e(hᵢ) = (0,0)` ∧ `Σᵢ turnᵢ = 12` | proposed — **pending OD-6/OD-7** |
| **K₁** | seam containment | error `= 0` in a frame interior; `≤ ε_seam` and deterministic on the seam (§6) | proposed |
| **K₂** | seam arbitration | exact at `κ ≤ 1`; deterministic pairwise at `κ = 2`; conservative + counted at `κ ≥ 3` (§6) | proposed — `X4` is **stronger** |

## 2. Proposed grammar of `𝕄*`

**Now bounded by the foxel schema** (`ROUNDTRIP` §2.4): every production below must draw into
`layer* × point → (height, material, wall1..3, item)` exactly, or it is not admissible. OD-6 and
OD-7 are closed; what remains proposed is the *description* layer, not the storage.

```ebnf
⟨model⟩    ::= { ⟨layer⟩ | ⟨stencil⟩ | ⟨place⟩ | ⟨line⟩ | ⟨join⟩ }
⟨layer⟩    ::= "layer" ⟨nat⟩ { ⟨element⟩ }   (* layer* is the OUTERMOST structure — OD-8 closed *)

(* A · stencil: a CLOSED turtle polygon in a LOCAL frame, headings from H₁₂ *)
⟨stencil⟩  ::= "stencil" ⟨name⟩ "h0" ⟨h0⟩ { ⟨element⟩ }
⟨element⟩  ::= ⟨side⟩ | ⟨arc⟩ | ⟨feature⟩ | ⟨roof⟩ | ⟨layer⟩
⟨side⟩     ::= "side" ⟨nat⟩ "len" ⟨nat⟩ "turn" ⟨turn⟩
⟨h0⟩       ::= ⟨nat⟩                        (* initial heading h ∈ H₁₂ = ℤ/12 *)
⟨turn⟩     ::= ⟨int⟩                        (* Δh ∈ -5..6, twelfths of a revolution *)
⟨arc⟩      ::= "arc"  ⟨nat⟩ "ctr" ⟨point⟩ "rad" ⟨nat⟩ "from" ⟨rat⟩ "to" ⟨rat⟩
⟨feature⟩  ::= ⟨kind⟩ "side" ⟨nat⟩ "t" ⟨rat⟩ "w" ⟨nat⟩ [ "sill" ⟨nat⟩ "head" ⟨nat⟩ ]
                                            (* stored as a MATERIAL on the wall slot — 2.4.1 *)
⟨side⟩ shape ::= "straight" | "rounded"     (* a slot may be rounded — this is how arcs store *)
⟨place⟩    ::= "place" ⟨name⟩ "at" ⟨point⟩ "orient" ⟨orient⟩
⟨orient⟩   ::= ⟨rot⟩ [ "flip" ]             (* o ∈ O — the ONLY choice a placement makes *)
⟨rot⟩      ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5"

(* B · world linework: drawn in WORLD coordinates, direction follows the run *)
⟨line⟩     ::= "line" ⟨lkind⟩ ⟨nat⟩ "from" ⟨point⟩ "dir" ⟨dir⟩ "len" ⟨nat⟩
⟨join⟩     ::= "join" ⟨nat⟩ ⟨nat⟩ "rad" ⟨nat⟩       (* G¹ arc joining two ⟨line⟩s *)
⟨lkind⟩    ::= "road" | "wall" | "cliff"

(* shared terminals *)
⟨point⟩    ::= ⟨int⟩ "," ⟨int⟩              (* lattice, or half-integer at edge midpoints *)
⟨dir⟩      ::= ⟨int⟩ "," ⟨int⟩              (* reduced; ∈ D — reachable ONLY from ⟨line⟩ *)
⟨rat⟩      ::= ⟨int⟩ "/" ⟨nat⟩              (* reduced; never a decimal *)
⟨int⟩,⟨nat⟩ ::= decimal integer
⟨name⟩,⟨kind⟩ ::= DEFERRED
⟨roof⟩     ::= a HEIGHT per point           (* OD-2 closed: heights are stored, profiles are R2 *)
```

Two intents the grammar is meant to *enforce* rather than assert:

- **`⟨dir⟩` is unreachable from `⟨stencil⟩`** — "a stencil at one of 24 directions" is
  *unparseable*, not merely invalid.
- **There is no `⟨float⟩` production** — a model needing a float is unparseable, so the fitting
  criterion is enforced by the parser.

| quantity | stored as | never stored as |
|---|---|---|
| position | `(q,r) ∈ Λ`, half-integer at edge midpoints | metres |
| direction — **A** | `h ∈ H₁₂`, via `h0` + running `Σ turn` | degrees, or a `⟨dir⟩` |
| direction — **B** | reduced `d ∈ D` | degrees |
| length | **step count** along `e(h)` (A) or `d` (B) | metres |
| radius, sill, head, height | step count | metres |
| parameter along a side | reduced `⟨rat⟩` | decimal |

Metres and degrees are **derived for display**. Lattice lengths are irrational
(`‖(2,1)‖ = 1.5√7 m`), so storing metres would forfeit exactness.

## 3. Canonical text `𝕋`, and damage

Proposed rules — a model has **exactly one** spelling:

1. **C1 integers only** — every numeric token is `⟨int⟩`, `⟨nat⟩` or reduced `⟨rat⟩`.
2. **C2 fixed order** — elements sorted by `(kind, index, t)`; fields in declaration order.
   **`kind` orders by a fixed registry position, never alphabetically** — new kinds are appended
   (§4).
3. **C3 reduced forms** — `⟨dir⟩` and `⟨rat⟩` in lowest terms.
4. **C4 fixed layout** — single space separators, one element per line, no trailing space.
5. **C5 defaults are omitted** — an optional field is written only when it differs from its
   default, and the default reproduces prior behaviour exactly (§4).

*Illustrative only — the rules are the proposal, not the token spellings:*

```
stencil house1  h0 0
side  0  len 4  turn 3
side  1  len 5  turn 3
side  2  len 4  turn 3
side  3  len 5  turn 3
door  side 3  t 1/2  w 1
win   side 3  t 1/5  w 1  sill 2  head 5
place house1  at 3,-2  orient 4 flip

line  road 0  from 0,0    dir 2,1  len 40
line  road 1  from 31,18  dir 1,1  len 25
join  0 1  rad 6
```

Law **J** on that stencil: `Σ turn = 12` ✓, and `4·e(0) + 5·e(3) + 4·e(6) + 5·e(9) = (0,0)` ✓
since `e(h+6) = −e(h)`.

### 3.1 What is stored — settled by the foxel schema

| | stored? | role |
|---|---|---|
| `𝕋` — a body's **original** | **yes** | the truth for that body, in its local frame |
| `P` — its **pose** | **yes** | where it is in the world; free of the lattice |
| `𝔽_loc` — its local field | **no** — `draw(original)`, on demand | what collision, render and destruction read |
| `𝔽_wld` — terrain + linework | **yes** | the world's own truth |

This scopes `SPEC` **L3** rather than weakening it: *"the field is the stored truth"* holds for
the **world**; a **body**'s truth is its original plus its pose. **OD-6 is closed by the schema**
(`ROUNDTRIP` §2.4): whatever is stored, the model may only express what the foxel can hold, so
`𝕋` and the field describe the *same* admissible set.

### 3.2 Damage — the one place the original is lost

Destruction mutates `𝔽_loc` directly. The original no longer describes the body and is **not
recoverable** — a ruin is not an invertible transform of a house. So the damaged field is
**re-canonicalised to a new original, by approximation**:

```
𝔽_loc ──mutate──▶ 𝔽′ ──rebuild──▶ (m′, ρ) ──write──▶ 𝕋′       ρ > 0 is EXPECTED and REPORTED
```

`𝕋′` becomes the stored original from that moment; the pre-damage `𝕋` is history, not a second
truth. **This is the only step where `ρ > 0` is legitimate**, and it is legitimate precisely
because it produces a *new original* rather than pretending to recover the old one — which is why
law **E** splits into `E₁`/`E₂`/`E₃`.

## 4. Growing the language — proposed extension contract

This is infrastructure built out **like a programming language**: `⟨tower⟩`, `⟨bridge⟩`, `⟨prop⟩`
and new parameters get added over years. Adding a keyword must never change a program already
written — law **A₂**.

| adding | the trap | the rule that prevents it |
|---|---|---|
| a **verb** (`⟨tower⟩`) | sorting `kind` alphabetically makes it interleave, **re-spelling every existing text** | **C2** — registry order, appended |
| a **parameter** | writing it always adds a token to every existing element | **C5** — omitted at default |

A re-spelling is not cosmetic: `𝕋` **is** the stored truth for a body (§3.1), so it would
invalidate every stored original and every fixture at once.

> **The census window.** Restrictions can be added to `fits?` **freely while phase A runs and
> nothing has been authored against it**. Once texts exist in the wild, tightening `fits?` is a
> **breaking change** with no migration — nobody can re-derive geometry a person hand-placed. Run
> the whole ladder, **A8 included**, before the editor ships content.

### 4.1 Worked example — adding `octagon` to the slot shape vocabulary

*"There will be octagon wall types too, for octagonal towers and bay-windows — but that is an
example of how we extend our grammar."* It is the **cheapest** shape of extension, and worth
walking because it shows both what A₂ protects and what it does not.

**A new value in an existing vocabulary**, not a new production: `straight | rounded | octagon`.
It serves two scales at once — an octagonal tower and a bay window are the same chamfer.

| A₂ obligation | why `octagon` satisfies it |
|---|---|
| **C2** kind ordering | a *shape value* is not a new element kind, so nothing re-sorts |
| **C5** defaults omitted | `straight` is the default and is written nowhere, so no existing text gains a token |
| bytes unchanged | existing texts contain no shape token at all → **byte-identical**, trivially |
| `𝕄*` grows, never shrinks | it only admits more; nothing already authorable is withdrawn |

> **But A₂ is not sufficient — and this is the rule the example exposes.** A₂ protects the *text*
> layer. It says nothing about **law F**, injectivity. A newly admitted form can **collide with an
> existing one**: at small sizes an `octagon` run and a `rounded` run may rasterise to the same
> cells, and then `rebuild` cannot tell which was authored, even though every existing text still
> has identical bytes.
>
> **So every vocabulary extension re-opens the census** over the enlarged space — and when a new
> form collides with an admitted one, it is **the new form that is refused**, never the old.
> `𝕄*`-grows-never-shrinks decides the tie: the old form may already have content depending on
> it, the new one cannot.

This gives the extension procedure, in order: add the value → re-run `rt_census_a` over the
enlarged space → refuse whatever new form collides → confirm `rt_extend` still byte-matches every
prior fixture. Three of those four steps are gates that already exist.

## 5. `fits?`, and the doorstep

```
fits?(m)  ⟺  syn(m) ∧ sem(m)
```

| layer | statement | decided by |
|---|---|---|
| **syn** | derivable from the §2 grammar | the parser |
| **sem·A** | *(stencil)* the boundary **cycle** is closed (law **J**) and **unique** among admitted stencils | the stencil census |
| **sem·B** | *(linework)* — **note `X3`**: representability is settled, so this is a *cost* bound, not a threshold | the linework census |
| **sem·C** | *(arcs, joins)* `(rad, span) ∈ Sep`, `G¹` at joins | `Sep` · `junction_g0` |

### 5.1 The two recovery mechanisms differ, and must stay different

|  | **A · stencil** | **B · linework** |
|---|---|---|
| matched object | the **whole closed boundary cycle** | an **open run** |
| direction set | `H₁₂` | `D` — 24 |
| span length | **short spans permitted** | long by nature |
| recovery | **exact match against the enumerated cycle set** | direction recovery |
| injectivity proved by | **exhaustive enumeration** per level, to the discovered frontier | a cost bound |

**Why stencils need no length bound.** An isolated 1-step span cannot fix its heading — one hex
edge lies on one of **3 axes**, which cannot distinguish **12** headings. But a stencil side is
never isolated: by `SPEC` **I3** a wall is the boundary of a *filled region*, so the matched
object is the **closed cycle**, whose corners carry the turn sequence that disambiguates the
short sides. *(This argument depends on **I3**, hence on **OD-7**.)*

### 5.2 The limit sits at the doorstep

**The bounds are not the problem** — there is room inside them, and a restriction found by the
census is a **fact to record**, not a defect to engineer away. What matters is that nothing
outside `𝕄*` gets in.

> **The editor refuses at authoring time.** Not a warning, not a downstream check, not a failure
> at `rebuild`. If a thing cannot survive, it cannot be made. `authorable ⊆ { m : fits?(m) }`.

Deferred breakage separates symptom from cause: a building authored on Monday looks right,
round-trips right, and breaks after a flip / beside its neighbour / once damaged, with nothing on
screen pointing back at the authoring choice. **"Eventually broken" is why law C₂ exists**:

| `op ∈ Ops` | the deferred break it would otherwise cause |
|---|---|
| `flip` | authored fine, wrong after a mirrored placement |
| `place` | fine in the local frame, wrong once seated |
| `combine` | fine alone, broken beside its neighbour — rung **A8**, the least visible axis |
| `damage` | fine intact, un-re-canonicalisable as a ruin |
| `seat` | fine on flat ground, unseatable on real terrain |

There are exactly **two doors** into `𝕄*`, and both are guarded: the **editor** (`fits?`) and
**`rebuild`** (lands in `𝕄*` by `E₁`). A refusal **names its restriction** and offers the nearest
fitting alternative with its residual — never a silent snap, never a blank rejection.

*Prior art:* `X5` — *"a stencil rotated by a non-multiple of 60° must be refused, not silently
rounded"* — is this principle, pre-dating it, generalised here from rotation to all of `Ops`.

## 6. Frames, the seam, and contention

Collision reads **several presentations at once**: the unmovable base world plus every posed body.
Each belongs to one **frame** — `Φ_wld` (identity) or `Φ_b` (the body's pose). Inside a frame
geometry is exact; **across frames it cannot be**, because a pose is continuous. Where two frames'
geometry meets there are **cracks** — the **seam** `Σ`.

**Enforced by construction, not discipline.** Every cross-frame query routes through one path:

```
  world query ──[ p⁻¹ ]──▶ local query ──exact test in 𝔽_loc──▶ hit ──[ p ]──▶ world
                    └────────── the ONLY inexact step ──────────┘
```

The pose transform is the sole floating-point step *and* is already the `I5` chokepoint, so `Σ` is
where error lives because it is the only place a transform happens.

**Forbidden fix:** closing a crack by *moving geometry* — snapping a body's wall onto the world
lattice. That relocates seam error into a frame **interior** and voids **D** for that body.

**Jank is not licence for nondeterminism.** `L7`/`I9` need byte-identical replay, so seam error
must be a deterministic function of its inputs. A crack that differs between two runs of the same
derailment is a defect, not an allowed imprecision.

### 6.1 Contention

Two kinds of disagreement, handled differently:

| kind | example | handling |
|---|---|---|
| **numerical** | a contact point computed in `Φ_a` vs `Φ_b` | **removed by construction** — compute cross-frame quantities in **one designated frame**, single-valued because only one computation happens |
| **categorical** | world says *gap*, body says *solid* | arbitration, by contention degree `κ` |

| `κ` | regime | requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `≤ 1` | no contention | **exact** |
| `= 2` | **the designed-for case** | deterministic pairwise arbitration over a total order on frames |
| `≥ 3` | rare | total, deterministic, **conservative** — and **counted** |

Two requirements that are easy to omit silently: a **total order on frames** (a "whichever is
nearer" tie-break resolved by iteration order breaks replay), and a **fail-safe direction** —
prefer *solid* over *gap*, which composes with `I4` so a crack yields a spurious contact rather
than a body falling through the world.

> **`X4` is stronger than K₂ and should probably replace it.** crawler requires overlapping
> stencils arbitrate *"deterministically **and order-freely**"* — order-free means the result does
> not depend on order at all, not merely on a fixed one. Its **level separation** also does work
> `κ` would otherwise have to: two objects on different levels never contend.

> **`κ ≥ 3` is a counter, not an assumption**, and the scene that maximises it is **`G★` itself**
> — a pile of tumbled wagons is many overlapping frames. A point query rarely finds 3 at once; a
> **swept volume** straddles frames far more easily. Measure it there, not in a two-body fixture.

## 7. Open constants

| constant | domain | produced by | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Cyc` | A | the stencil census, grown by level (§8) | **OPEN** |
| `period` | B | the linework census | **OPEN — probably the wrong instrument**; `X3` says representability was never the question, only cost |
| `Sep` | B | the arc sweep | **OPEN** — and aimed at a different objective than `X7`'s collision-match |
| `D` | B | — | **CLOSED** — all 24 representable (`X3`) |
| `ε_seam` | frames | measured at the chokepoint | **OPEN** |
| `κ≥3` rate | frames | `rt_contend`, in the `G★` pile | **OPEN** — asserted low, unmeasured |

## 8. Method — grow, don't presuppose

**Do not define the admitted space and then enumerate it.** That presupposes the bounds, and the
bounds *are* the answer. The restrictions are the **output**.

```
  level n:  enumerate EXHAUSTIVELY at this level ──▶ round-trip each ──▶ all pass?
                          ▲                                              │  yes → n+1
                          └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                       the failing pair IS a restriction ─┘  no
```

Within the frontier law **F** is *decided*, not sampled — the growth loop sits **outside** the
enumeration, not instead of it. Every level is a complete gated increment, so the work always has
something green rather than one long red run to a verdict.

**Two growth axes**, and the second is where the discoveries are: **form** (minimal cycle → longer
sides → more sides → unequal → non-convex → features → arcs) and **combination** (two stencils
adjacent, stencil against linework, stencil on terrain). Things that round-trip alone routinely
stop round-tripping combined.

**The smallest form is concrete.** By law **J** a stencil needs `Σ turn = 12` and a closing vector
sum, so the minimum is **3 sides** — an equilateral triangle, `turn 4` at each corner, closing
because three lattice vectors 120° apart sum to zero: `(1,0) + (−1,1) + (0,−1) = (0,0)`.

> **Method warning `X9`, earned in crawler.** *"Before width-normalising, this table appeared to
> show the VERTEX directions as the worst of all. That was an artefact — a fixed nominal halfwidth
> yields 17/29/19 cells by direction, so the raw spread was measuring width, not heading. Fitting
> `W` per direction **reversed the conclusion**."* The census has the identical hazard: forms at
> different headings enclose different cell counts, so raw spread conflates **size** with
> **heading**. A census that skips this produces a confident, ranked, **inverted** table.

### 8.0 The corpus — what the ladder actually produces

Each rung's enumeration is not thrown away. **The entries are the deliverable**, kept permanently,
and they accumulate into hexbody's own **T1** tier (`ROUNDTRIP` §7.1) — the thing almost no
inherited prior art gives us.

Shape of an entry, one per admitted form:

```
corpus/<rung>/<case>.t          the canonical text T          — the authored truth
corpus/<rung>/<case>.f          draw(read(T)), or its digest  — what it rasterises to
```

and the gate over the whole corpus is one line, by **P3**/**P4**:

```
for every entry:   write(rebuild(draw(read(T))))  ==  T        byte-for-byte
for every pair:    f(a) != f(b)                                law F, injectivity
```

**Why this is affordable exhaustively.** No golden images, no tolerance, no per-case judgement —
the check is `diff`. That is the practical payoff of keeping `𝕋` float-free (**C1**), and it is
why the ladder can enumerate a level *completely* instead of sampling it.

**Why the entries are kept rather than regenerated.** `rt_extend` replays every prior entry after
any grammar change and demands byte-identical output (law **A₂**). Regenerating them would make
that gate vacuous — it would compare new output against new output and always pass. **A corpus
that regenerates is a gate that cannot fire.**

**A rung is done when** its level is exhaustively enumerated, every entry round-trips, no two
entries collide, and any restriction found is enforceable at the door (§5.2).

### 8.1 The rungs come from the scene, not the desk

§8 is the method; it is not the work-list. The current work — **a landscape with houses, trees and
a tower** — decides which rungs exist and in what order. It is not a demo of the infrastructure;
it is the **instrument that finds the infrastructure's gaps**. A contract makes the axes you
already see safe; only a real scene converts an axis nobody imagined into one you can gate.

| the scene has | it exercises | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **houses** | polygonal stencils, features, `H₁₂` | the ladder's spine |
| **a tower** | **arcs**, immediately with features — the **doored-tower defect** (`design/FEATURES.md` §3): a wall with a door fitting **3 arcs instead of 1** | arcs move from the last rung to the middle; the defect is a named law **D** failure |
| **trees** | a class with **no verb** | **OD-3** |
| **the landscape** | terrain with **no production**, plus seating | **OD-4** |

## 9. Proposed gates

| gate | law | test | control |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rt_canon` | A₁ | text diff | reorder a field → diff |
| `rt_extend` | A₂ | replay every prior fixture; bytes **identical** | sort `kind` alphabetically → later verbs re-spell every text |
| `rt_project` | B | equality + `ρ = 0` | perturb by ½ step → `ρ ≠ 0` |
| `rt_fits` | C₁ | `fits?` vs `σ(m) = m` | a cycle in the collision set → `fits?` false |
| `rt_closure` | C₂ | `∀m, ∀op ∈ Ops. fits?(op(m))` | admit a form whose `flip` leaves `𝕄*` → fires at the door |
| `rt_door` | C₂ | every editor op yields `fits?`; refusals name their restriction | let the editor emit a non-fitting model → `rt_trip` breaks downstream instead |
| **`rt_trip`** | **D** | **`write(rebuild(draw(read(T)))) ≟ T`** | a non-fitting model bypassing `σ` → diff |
| `rt_total` | E₁ | `σ(rebuild(f)) = rebuild(f)` for arbitrary `f` | hand-corrupt an `EdgeSet` → still lands in `𝕄*` |
| `rt_ruin` | E₂,E₃ | `ρ = 0` on `im(draw)`; reported off it | crumble a wall → `ρ > 0` surfaced, not swallowed |
| `rt_census_a` | F | grown by level; **reports the frontier** | remove a corner's turn from the match key → collisions at level 1 |
| `rt_census_b` | F | the domain-B cost table | — |
| `rt_close` | J | `Σ lenᵢ·e(hᵢ) = 0` ∧ `Σ turnᵢ = 12` | drop one turn → non-zero sum |
| `rt_seam` | K₁ | error `≡ 0` in interiors; `≤ ε_seam` on `Σ` | "fix" a crack by snapping a body wall → interior error ≠ 0 |
| `rt_contend` | K₂ | `κ` histogram over the `G★` pile | tie-break on iteration order → replay diverges |
| `rt_flip` | G | text diff | asymmetric feature → diff |
| `rt_drift` | H | text diff after `φ¹²` | inject a rounding step → drift |
| `rt_orient` | I | field equality over `O × Λ` | — **GREEN** |

`rt_trip` must be **enumeration-driven** over primitive kinds — a new primitive without
`write`/`draw`/`rebuild` coverage fails the gate rather than going silently ungated.

**OD-1 · the morph — dead, or moved into `snap`?**
`design/EDITOR.md` §2 makes orientation a *minimal affine morph*, *"the bridge from 6 exact
rotations to **many**."* A morph is a **non-lattice affine map**, so a morphed wall lands outside
`𝕄*` and no exact round trip exists for it. EDITOR §2 names the second break itself — *"a general
two-axis morph turns a circular arc into an ellipse"*.

Free poses narrow this sharply: a building at 37° is simply a **free-posed body**, exact in its
own frame. The morph is needed **only** for a **seated** body that must share lattice cells.

| option | consequence |
|---|---|
| **(c)** unnecessary *(cheapest)* | open question shrinks to: does a *seated* building ever need an angle outside the 12? Only if a walker crosses street↔interior on shared cells at that angle |
| **(a)** superseded | EDITOR §2 deleted; free poses cover the rest |
| **(b)** into `snap` | a lossy seating convenience with residual `ρ`, never stored; `𝕄*` and **D** untouched |

**OD-2 · are roofs inside the exact round trip?**
`Heights` is neither domain A nor B: a roof is a continuous surface sampled into a height field
(`hexroof`: cone, ridge, vault, hip, dome, groin, cloister). The tree already implements recovery
*with a tolerance* — `roof_match(s, f, tol: float)` (`src/hexroof.loft:493`), which is the `ε`
**P4** forbids. Options: **(a)** roofs excluded — `𝕋` carries roof *parameters* and `Heights` is a
derived render product never recovered; **(b)** roofs are a **domain C** with an exact inverse per
profile.

**OD-3 · are trees in `𝕄*` at all?**
The scene has trees; the grammar has no verb. Either an **instanced prop** (pose + kit piece,
never round-tripped — cheaper, matches VISION's kitbashing route) or **field geometry** (a canopy
occupying cells, which makes a tree *fellable* and its stump derivable). **Do not decide from
here** — crawler holds `plans/9-canopy-trees/TREES.md` plus `src/canopy*.loft`, and `PROPS.md`.

**OD-4 · is terrain inside the exact round trip?**
No `⟨terrain⟩` production. Structurally identical to OD-2, so answer them together. Prior art:
crawler `plans/8-landform-morphogenesis/`.

---

The four below are **conflicts with settled prior art**, surfaced by inspecting crawler against
this design. Each has a position already argued somewhere. **OD-6 is the deepest and probably
orders the rest.**

**OD-5 · is the flip exact?** *(contradicts `X2`)*
Laws **G**/**H** treat the flip as *mutating by approximation*, with `rt_drift` built to measure
drift, and `SPEC` **L4** superseded on that basis. But `X2` says reflection is `k → −k`, **exact**
— so `flip∘flip = id` by construction, `rt_drift` is trivially green, and **H** is a theorem.

Three things are conflated under "the flip", and separating them likely dissolves this: the
**lattice reflection** (exact, `X2`); the **morph** (genuinely approximate — OD-1); and the
**handedness residual** (backwards text, hinges on the wrong side — a *content* problem, and the
reason EDITOR wants no mirror at all).

**OD-6 · is a stencil a *field* or a *generative description*?** *(the foundational one)*

| | crawler — stencil-as-field | here — stencil-as-description |
|---|---|---|
| the object | `(extent, HexSet, Labels?, Heights?, EdgeSet?, Features?, props?)` — *"a small **field**, not a bitmap"* | a **turtle polygon** |
| stored | the field itself | the canonical text `𝕋` |
| round trip | stamp → un-stamp restores `𝔽` **bit-for-bit** | `write(rebuild(draw(read(T)))) = T` |
| gives you | placement and removal, exactly | **parametric editing** — change a length, re-derive |
| recovery needed? | no — nothing was ever lost | yes — the whole contract |

Both can coexist (a description that *generates* a field which is then stamped), but the spec must
say which is the **stored truth** — §3.1 answers `𝕋`, crawler answers the field. It also decides
how much of **D**/**E₂** is load-bearing: if the field is stored, `rebuild` is only needed for
**R2**.

**OD-7 · which wall model?** *(contradicts `SPEC` I3; `X10` is validated)*

| | `SPEC` **I3** — boundary of a filled region | crawler `WALLS.md` — triangle-subdivision band |
|---|---|---|
| storage | `EdgeSet` — edges between in-cell and out-cell | triangles: each hex edge = **3 sub-segments** |
| thickness | none — a wall is an edge | **free**, one triangle → two hexes |
| interior walls | not expressible | *"just more wall-bands inside the footprint"* |
| 24 directions | needs the fit | *"straight + sharp + 24-direction **for free**"* |
| a door | **annotates**, never deletes (`FEATURES.md`) | *"**remove** a span of the band's triangles"* |
| status | shipping in `housedraw`, gated | validated in 2D, corner tests pass (`X10`) |

The door row is a **direct contradiction** between `design/FEATURES.md` and `WALLS.md`. It may
dissolve — deleting an *edge* fragments a run (the doored-tower defect), while deleting *band
triangles* need not, because a band is not a run — but the spec cannot hold both. This decides
rungs **A5/A7**, the `⟨side⟩` production, and whether `𝕄*` needs a thickness parameter at all.

**OD-8 · when do layers enter?**
`⟨layer⟩` is DEFERRED here. crawler `STENCILS.md`: stencils are *"multi-layer — a vertical stack
of hex planes, with ladders/stairs connecting adjacent layers… Layers are part of the model **from
the start**, not bolted on"* — with a gameplay pillar (climb tower → traverse rampart → drop into
a keep sealed at ground level; *"the route is the lock"*). By law **A₂** a deferred axis is not
free: adding one later must not re-spell existing texts, and a layer axis touches every element.
Cheaper to admit now, even unused. `X4`'s level separation is the mechanism layers would use for
arbitration.

*(Folded in rather than numbered: the grammar has no **wall thickness** and no **interior walls** —
OD-7 decides both.)*

## 10.1 Follow-up created by the doors-as-materials fix

**Compound materials.** A doored edge now carries `OPEN_DOOR`, having lost `WALL_COTTAGE` — the
loss `ROUNDTRIP` §2.4.1 predicts. Nothing today reads a doored edge's wall material, so the gate
and the render are unaffected; but **`rebuild` will need it**, because recovering "a door in a
cottage wall" from a bare `OPEN_DOOR` is impossible. The material vocabulary must carry the
composition before phase **E**. Cost: the table grows with (wall kinds × feature kinds).

## 10.2 The round trip already exists in moros — and it is lossy, with a false-green test

`../moros/lib/moros_map/src/moros_map.loft` § *the shared document format* (moros#4) is the same
seam one level down: **storage** round trip rather than **model** round trip. Its own comment:

> *"Moros's dense 8-byte cell and hex_field's parallel arrays are ONE model — moros#1 probed it —
> with the cell as a storage concern over the field. This is that seam: a Map layer converts to a
> field, writes through hex_field's format, and comes back.*
>
> *What crosses today: occupancy, height, material. **Items, item rotation and the three wall
> bytes do NOT** — this writer calls the cells/heights/labels form of `doc_write` and never builds
> an `EdgeSet`. That is now OUR gap, not the format's. hex_field grew an edge section on
> 2026-07-22 … so walls could cross today."*

**Three of the six foxel slots do not survive the existing round trip.** And the test that should
catch it is green for the wrong reason — the comment says so itself:

> *"`test_items_and_walls_do_not_survive_yet` does NOT catch this: it was written to fail 'the day
> a section appears', but it watches our round trip, and our round trip drops the walls before the
> format ever sees them — **so the section appeared and the test stayed green**. Carrying the walls
> is what makes it fail, and then it wants deleting rather than fixing."*

A gate that cannot fire is not a gate — the house rule, and here is a live instance, already
diagnosed by its author. Two consequences for M0:

- **`draw`'s target is this seam.** Whatever hexbody emits has to cross it, so the census and
  `rt_trip` should measure against the **moros `Hex` schema**, not against `hex_field`'s structures
  in isolation.
- **Carrying walls across is a prerequisite, not a detail.** Until the three wall bytes survive,
  no stencil with walls can round-trip through the shared format at all — which is every stencil.

**Open question this raises:** is hexbody's `draw` meant to write **moros `Map` layers directly**,
or to write `hex_field` documents that moros then loads? The comment says the two are *"ONE
model … with the cell as a storage concern over the field"*, so either can be the seam — but the
census must be written against whichever one is authoritative.

## 10.3 Connections — vehicles and robot limbs: a graph beside the field, not slots in it

**The question:** couplings and joints are *sparse* — a wagon has two, a limb has one — but each
must hold a **specific point**. Where do they live, when storage is a dense per-cell foxel?

**They cannot live in the foxel, and crawler already says why.** `hexskel`'s opening line is the
principle:

> *"This is the first **graph** in the whole system. Everything before it was a **field**: a value
> per cell, per edge, per chunk. A tree's branch structure is **not a field and cannot be fitted
> like one** — the roof matcher recovers a cone by solving for five parameters, but a skeleton has
> a **variable number of nodes** and no amount of least-squares will produce one."*

That is the whole answer in two sentences, and it has a sharp consequence for this contract:

| | fabric | **mechanism** | dressing |
|---|---|---|---|
| shape | **field** — dense, fixed arity per cell | **graph** — sparse, **variable** arity | sparse sub-hex objects |
| examples | walls, floors, roofs, terrain | couplings, hinges, axles, the part-tree | drainpipes, lamps |
| in the foxel | **yes** | **no** | no |
| recoverable | yes — R1 exact, R2 fitted | **no — a fit needs fixed arity; a graph has none** | no |
| bounded by `fits?` | yes | no | no |

**So mechanism is authored or derived, never recovered.** This is not a gap to close: it is a
category difference. A cone is five parameters, so `roof_match` can solve for it; a part-graph has
no parameter vector to solve for, so no amount of fitting produces one. Law **D** is over *fabric*
— a model with anchors does not violate it, because anchors were never in `draw`'s image.

**crawler already has the representation.** `hexpart`: *"Two levels, no more: an **anchor**, and
parts in the anchor's frame"*, with the **granularity rule** deciding what earns a part —
*"split where something moves independently, merge where it does not… merge too far and animation
is impossible, split too far and every prop pays for degrees of freedom it does not have."*
`hexhinge` places a leaf at a continuous `(hx, hy)`; `hexlink` derives a whole valve gear in
closed form from one wheel phase.

### 10.3.1 The open part — how an anchor is *addressed*

`hexpart`/`hexhinge` use **float** local coordinates, which is right at the mesh level but breaks
**P4** if an anchor is written into `𝕋`: byte-equality has no floats to compare.

The likely resolution, and it reuses machinery that already exists: **address an anchor the way a
feature is addressed** — `(side, t)` with `t` a reduced rational, plus a step-count height. That
is **affine-invariant** (`SPEC` **I2**), so a coupling survives orientation *exactly*, which
`I10` requires — *"a coupling point stays coincident every tick"* — and it keeps `𝕋` float-free.
The float `(hx, hy)` then becomes what it should be: a **derived evaluation** of an exact
address, exactly as metres are derived from step counts.

**What is genuinely undecided:** whether an anchor is addressed against the **boundary** (`side`,
`t`) — natural for a drawbar on a wagon's front face — or against a **cell/vertex** — natural for
an axle inside the footprint. A hinge is on a wall; an axle is not. It may need both, and then the
question is whether that is one address type with two forms or two kinds of anchor.
